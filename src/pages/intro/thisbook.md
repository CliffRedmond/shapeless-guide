## About this book

In the following chapters,
we discuss a few of the most common features of shapeless
used by library authors:

 - Chapter 2 provides a quick recap of algebraic data types in Scala,
   and discusses the data types shapeless uses
   to provide generic representations of ADTs.
   At the end of this chapter we will be able to
   convert back and forth between representations,
   converting `Employees` to `IceCreams`
   and all manner of other mischief.

 - TODO: Describe Chapter 3 (type class instance derivation)

 - TODO: Describe Chapter 4 (making use of field and type names)
