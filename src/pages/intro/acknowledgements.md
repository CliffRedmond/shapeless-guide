## Acknowledgements

This book is built (written?) on the shoulders of giants.
In particular, I would like to thank:

 - Miles Sabin for his contributions and feedback.

 - Sam Halliday for this excellent workshop
   [Shapeless for Mortals][link-fommil-scalax-2015],
   from which I stole a *lot*.

 - The entire list of [shapeless contributors][link-shapeless-contribs],
   whose hard work has helped make shapeless what it is today.

 - My colleagues at [Underscore][link-underscore]
   who help me make a living from stuff like this.
