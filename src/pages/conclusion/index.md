# Conclusion #{-}

With Part II's look at `shapeless.ops`,
we have arrived at the end of this guide to shapeless.
We hope you found it useful for understanding
this fascinating and powerful library.

As functional programmers
we value abstraction above all else.
Concepts like functors and monads
arise from years of programming research:
writing code, spotting patterns,
and making abstractions to remove redundancy.
Shapeless raises the bar for abstraction in Scala.
Tools like `Generic` and `LabelledGeneric`
provide an interface for abstracting over data types
that we previously thought unique and distinct.

There have traditionally been two barriers to entry
for aspiring new shapeless users.
The first is the wealth of theoretical knowledge
and implementation detail
required to understand the bigger picture.
Hopefully this guide has done its job in this regard.
The second barrier is the fear and uncertainty
surrounding a library that is seen
as "academic" and "advanced".
We can overcome this by sharing knowledge
and showing each other the use cases,
advantages, and disadvantages of its use.
So please share this book with a friend...
and let's scrap some boilerplate together!
