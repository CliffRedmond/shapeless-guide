## Summary

In this chapter we discussed 
how shapeless represents natural numbers
and how to calculate the length 
of an `HList` or `Coproduct`.

Such calculations involve two parts:
one at the type level involving 
the `Length` type classes and the `Nat` type,
and one at the value level involving
the `ToInt` type class and regular `Ints`.
