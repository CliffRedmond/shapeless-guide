## Summary

In this chapter we discussed
how shapeless represents natural numbers
and how we can use them in type classes.
We saw some predefined ops type classes
that let us do things like calculate lengths
and access elements by index,
and created our own type classes
that use `Nat` in other ways.

Between `Nat`, `Poly`, and the variety of
type classes and examples we have seen in Part II,
we have seen just a small fraction of
the toolbox provided in `shapeless.ops`.
There are many other ops type classes
that provide a comprehensive foundation
on which to build our own code.
